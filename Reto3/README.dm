#Google Home Page Clone

Hi everyone, I would like to show you a Google Home Page's clone that I have been working on this weekend.

It is a simple page where I use only CSS and HTML. The purpose is to improve my skills in those languages.

You can see it on https://troogle.web.app/ 

I would like to receive your feedback because I always learn something about it.

Thank you all.
